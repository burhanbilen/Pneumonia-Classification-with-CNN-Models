# Pneumonia Classification with CNN Models

The project includes four CNN models which are AlexNet, VGG16, InceptionV3 and a Simple CNN. The idea is to classify pneumonia x-ray images by the chosen models.

Models were used with both Functional and Sequential APIs and Transfer Learning was applied on the InceptionV3 model.

The dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia but altered and used in the project. Also, altered dataset can be taken from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z6zrJlsCFyU7x6AGCARy9HJn8Shc1Fi7?usp=sharing.
